This session involved a return to implementing an example mini-project / problem / "kata" called the Shopping Cart, focusing on correct use of TDD.
During the session I did this in pair programming with someone who used Deno, and I'm re-doing it by myself after the fact for practise purposes, as Deno looks very convenient to use for such sessions moving forward thanks to its fast setup.

The kata was originally hosted at https://www.codurance.com/katas/shopping-cart-kata

# Shopping Cart Kata

What do we want to build?

We are building a shopping cart for an online grocery shop. The idea of this kata is to build the product in an iterative way.
Technical requirements

    The price per unit is calculated based on the product cost and the percentage of revenue that the company wants for that product.
    The price has to be rounded up; so if a price per unit calculated is 1.7825, then the expected price per unit for that product is 1.79
    The final price of the product is then calculated as the price per unit with the VAT rounded up.
    Products are not allowed to have the same name.

Possible API for the ShoppingCart

You could change this API this is only for example purposes.

Approach 1 passing objects as arguments could be DTO

public interface ShoppingCart {
public void addItem(Product product);
public void deleteItem(Product product);
public void applyDiscount(Discount discount)
public void printShoppingCart();
}

Approach 2 passing primitives as arguments

public interface ShoppingCart {
public void addItem(String productName);
public void deleteItem(String productName);
public void applyDiscount(Double discount)
public void printShoppingCart();
}

Approach 3 passing primitives as arguments and returning a DTO

public interface ShoppingCart {
public void addItem(String productName);
public void deleteItem(String productName);
public void applyDiscount(Double discount)
public ShoppingCartList getShoppingCart();
}

    The graphic examples that you can see in the assignment are not there to be implemented if you don't want to. They are provided as a reference of how the shopping cart works
